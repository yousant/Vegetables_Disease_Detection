# Vegetable Disease Classification

Welcome to the Vegetable Disease Prediction repository! This project aims to develop a machine learning and deep learning model to predict diseases in vegetables using images.

Overview
This repository contains all the necessary code, data, and resources to train and evaluate models for predicting diseases in various vegetables. By leveraging image data and deep learning techniques, we aim to build a robust system capable of accurately identifying diseases early on, aiding farmers in timely intervention and crop management.
